# JavaScript
Here I will post some JS codes from SoftUni exams. They include basic JS syntax, DOM events and HTTP requests. Some of the tasks require specific API that was provided by SoftUni. I didn't code the API's myself so I didn't include them in the files. The exams required us to code the JS for the provided HTML and CSS so the pajes are interactive. 

Here is a good example of an exercise with DOM events:
