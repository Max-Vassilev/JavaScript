# JavaScript
Here I will post some JS codes from SoftUni exams. They include basic JS syntax, DOM events and HTTP requests. Some of the tasks require specific API that was provided by SoftUni. I didn't code the API's myself so I didn't include them in the files. The exams required us to code the JS for the provided HTML and CSS so the pajes are interactive. 

Here is an example of an exercise with DOM events. You can save a song, give it a like or just delete it:
